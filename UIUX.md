Overall easy to utilise and navigate. Button has clear instruction
All pages has logout and back button to help navigate user

Login Screen, Register Screen
- Has link with Underlined, blue text pattern to help user navigate between login/register page

Dashboard Screen, Edit Game Screen
- Affordance: Use color to categorise buttons, white for data editing, blue for game controlling, red for deletion
- Integrate modal where necessary

Edit Question Screen
- Use whole screen instead of modal as there are lots of data to observe
- Add clear button to remove the input easier
- The blank inputs will be ignored, the question detail will update on the section that we have input. User don't need to input the same data in order to retain them.
