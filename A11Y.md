Accessibility

Perceivability
- Text alt and video title in this project is meaningful
- No text over photo

Understandability
login/register/joinGame page
- Used to have no label and put the label in placeholder to make the pages minimal
Changed according to accessibility guide by adding label and remove placeholder as placeholder text has pretty bad usability
- Error message displayed when:
1. has invalid input e.g. leave an input field blank
2. error occurs e.g. invalid credentials, session not active, session has begun

Robustness
- All HTML are parseable with no duplicate ids
- All elements have role e.g. button, anchor, input, header, etc.
